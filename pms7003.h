/*
This library was meant to bue used with the pms7003 plant tower module.
Although al the data sets are merged and saved in the "char DATA[]" array, only 
DATA[4,5,6] are being used as output of this library, those are respectively 
particle sizes 1.0, 2.5 and 10. data output is in micro grams per m^3
This library was created BY Manuel Rojas, use as is,
